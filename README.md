# Sun-Earth-Moon-system
Simulating the orbit of the Earth and the Moon around the Sun in our solar system with a very crude mathematical model that models orbital trajectories as simple circles. 
The Sun is located at the origin while the Earth orbits around it, with the moon orbitting the Earth simultaneously.

Perhaps I'll also try to create a similar simulation of this Sun-Earth-Moon System (SEMS) with a better mathematical model that involves differential equations and Newton's Law of Gravitation and see how they compare. Maybe from this, we will be able to observe Kepler's Laws of planetary motion
