Simulating the orbit of the Earth and the Moon around the Sun in our solar system with a very crude mathematical model that models orbital trajectories as simple circles. 
The Sun is located at the origin while the Earth orbits around it, with the moon orbiting the Earth simultaneously.

Incorporating an Differential Equations solver from the scipy.integrate library to solve the differential equation set up by Newton's 2nd Law and Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation to obtain a simulation of Earth orbitting Sun in circular motion

A generic code for simulating orbits of 3 masses that are gravitationally attracting each other.
